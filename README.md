This repository is meant to store a live copy of the custom themed documentation website for the latest stable Pyrogram release directly on GitHub, just in case the main hosted website becomes unavailable for any reason (rarely happens).

In total, there are three documentation websites:

- [`docs.pyrogram.ml`](//docs.pyrogram.ml) - main, custom themed website (preferred).
- [`pyrogram.github.io/docs`](//pyrogram.github.io/docs) - copy of the main website on GitHub.
- [`pyrogram.rtfd.io`](//pyrogram.rtfd.io)- extra website hosted on readthedocs.org.
